    I'm Kayla and I work as a web application developer, though this site has been developed separately in my own time. I love learning, whether it's app development, new web tools, or Irish of course! I had a lot of trouble finding good resources for Irish so I hope to add more and more options for people learning Irish. <br/>Besides web development I also love to travel and will be off to Ireland soon - I'll be continuing to record my adventures on my <a href='kmmartell.com'>blog</a>.<br/>
   
    If you have any suggestions or bugs for this site, you can <a href="https://github.com/kmmartell/Gaeilge/issues">submit them as issues to my github page</a> under this project.

    About the Gaeilge Translator
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    This web site has been created by me, because I can never find good resources for learning Irish and specifically the translation sites did not have all the functionality I needed. In particular, I could not find a site that did all three things: Translate English -> Irish, Irish-> English, and have pronunciation for all stages of this. <br/><br/>
    There are many sites that do each of these fairly well, so I have scraped three different sites to provide the information that you see searched here.
   <br/><br/>
    If you're interested in web development this site was programmed using Node.js and is hosted on IBM's bluemix.

    What's Coming Next
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    So we've got a pretty translator but what's next? You'll soon be able to save translations to your favourites, practice those saved translations, and download them to your computer.

  <p class="lead">
    And What About an App?
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    Let's face it - all the current Irish translation apps are either terrible or plain non-existent. 
    Now for the good news - I'll be turning the functionality of this site into an app as soon as I can. Expect an Irish transltor app, with sound, available before the end of June.
